# quoteproj
Nikki and Rainu's Project
We are creating our first web app using the MEAN stack (minus Angular.js) for now. 

The application will be a quote randomizer that takes a user's input for how they would like to feel, and 
gives them a quote that inspires, gives them hope, or pushes them through a hard situation.
